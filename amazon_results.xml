      Product Description
  The Ruby Programming Language is the authoritative guide to Ruby and provides comprehensive coverage of versions 1.8 and 1.9 of the language. It was written (and illustrated!) by an all-star team: David Flanagan, bestselling author of programming language &quot;bibles&quot; (including JavaScript: The Definitive Guide and Java in a Nutshell) and committer to the Ruby Subversion repository. Yukihiro &quot;Matz&quot; Matsumoto, creator, designer and lead developer of Ruby and author of Ruby in a Nutshell, which has been expanded and revised to become this book. why the lucky stiff, artist and Ruby programmer extraordinaire. This book begins with a quick-start tutorial to the language, and then explains the language in detail from the bottom up: from lexical and syntactic structure to datatypes to expressions and statements and on through methods, blocks, lambdas, closures, classes and modules. The book also includes a long and thorough introduction to the rich API of the Ruby platform, demonstrating -- with heavily-commented example code -- Ruby&apos;s facilities for text processing, numeric manipulation, collections, input/output, networking, and concurrency. An entire chapter is devoted to Ruby&apos;s metaprogramming capabilities. The Ruby Programming Language documents the Ruby language definitively but without the formality of a language specification. It is written for experienced programmers who are new to Ruby, and for current Ruby programmers who want to challenge their understanding and increase their mastery of the language.

      Product Description
  Ruby is perhaps best known as the engine powering the hugely popular Ruby on Rails web framework. However, it is an extremely powerful and versatile programming language in its own right. It focuses on simplicity and offers a fully object-oriented environment.    Beginning Ruby is a thoroughly contemporary guide for every type of reader wanting to learn Ruby, from novice programmers to web developers to Ruby newcomers. It starts by explaining the principles behind object-oriented programming and within a few chapters builds toward creating a genuine Ruby application.     The book then explains key Ruby principles, such as classes and objects; projects, modules, and libraries; and other aspects of Ruby such as database access. In addition, Ruby on Rails is covered in depth, and the books appendixes provide essential reference information as well as a primer for experienced programmers.

  Ruby is an increasingly popular, fully object-oriented dynamic programming language, hailed by many practitioners as the finest and most useful language available today. When Ruby first burst onto the scene in the Western world, the Pragmatic Programmers were there with the definitive reference manual, Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer&apos;s Guide.     Now in its Second Edition, author Dave Thomas has expanded the famous Pickaxe book with over 200 pages of new content, covering all the new and improved language features of Ruby 1.8 and standard library modules. The Pickaxe contains four major sections:   An acclaimed tutorial on using Ruby.   The definitive reference to the language.   Complete documentation on all built-in classes, modules, and methods   Complete descriptions of all 98 standard libraries.      If you enjoyed the First Edition, you&apos;ll appreciate the new and expanded content, including: enhanced coverage of installation, packaging, documenting Ruby source code, threading and synchronization, and enhancing Ruby&apos;s capabilities using C-language extensions. Programming for the world-wide web is easy in Ruby, with new chapters on XML/RPC, SOAP, distributed Ruby, templating systems and other web services. There&apos;s even a new chapter on unit testing.     This is the definitive reference manual for Ruby, including a description of all the standard library modules, a complete reference to all built-in classes and modules (including more than 250 significant changes since the First Edition). Coverage of other features has grown tremendously, including details on how to harness the sophisticated capabilities of irb, so you can dynamically examine and experiment with your running code. &quot;Ruby is a wonderfully powerful and useful language, and whenever I&apos;m working with it this book is at my side&quot; --Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist, ThoughtWorks

      Product Description
  Ruby is a fully object-oriented language, much like the classic object-oriented language, Smalltalk. Like Smalltalk, it is dynamically typed (as opposed to Java or C++), but unlike Smalltalk, Ruby features the same conveniences found in modern scripting languages, making Ruby a favorite tool of intelligent, forward-thinking programmers and the basis for the Rails web framework.    This is the reference manual for Ruby, including a description of all the standard library modules, a complete reference to all built-in classes and modules (including all the new and changed methods introduced by Ruby 1.9). It also includes all the new and changed syntax and semantics introduced since Ruby 1.8. Learn about the new parameter passing rules, local variable scoping in blocks, fibers, multinationalization, and the new block declaration syntax, among other exciting new features.

      Product Description
  There may be no better way to learn how to program than by   dissecting real, representative examples written in your language of   choice. Ruby by Example analyzes a series of Ruby scripts, examining   how the code works, explaining the concepts it illustrates, and showing how   to modify it to suit your needs. Baird&apos;s examples demonstrate key features   of the language (such as inheritance, encapsulation, higher-order   functions, and recursion), while simultaneously solving difficult problems   (such as validating XML, creating a bilingual program, and creating   command-line interfaces). Each chapter builds upon the previous, and each   key concept is highlighted in the margin to make it easier for you to   navigate the book.  You&apos;ll learn how to:    Use the interactive Ruby shell (irb) to learn key features of the   language  Extend Ruby using RubyGems, the Ruby package manager  Create numerical utilities, as well as utilities that process and   analyze HTML/XML  Implement purely functional and metaprogramming techniques to save time   and effort  Optimize, profile, and test your code to make sure that it not only   does its job, but does it well  Create web applications using Rails    Ruby is the fastest growing programming language today, and for good   reason: Its elegant syntax and readable code make for prolific and happy   programmers.

      Review
  &quot;It&apos;s early days for the language so it&apos;s no surprise there&apos;s only a handful of books out there. Yet it&apos;s hard to see why you would need anything more than Agile Web Development with Rails.  Programming books, in particular, rarely seem to answer queries straight away, but this one tackles the myths surrounding Rails straight off, and in plain English. But don&apos;t panic, it&apos;s not a Dummies guide - it will teach you how to use Rails to eliminate tedious web app configuration and, crucially, how to integrate it into AJAX.&quot; .NET, December 2005

      Product Description
  The definitive, Jolt-award winning guide to learning and using Rails is now in its Second Edition. Rails is a new approach to web-based application development that enables developers to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications using less code and less effort. Now programmers can get the job done right and still leave work on time.    NEW IN THE SECOND EDITION: The book has been updated to take advantage of all the new Rails 1.2 features. The sample application uses migrations, Ajax, features a REST interface, and illustrates new Rails features. There are new chapters on migrations, active support, active record, and action controller (including the new resources-based routing). The Web 2.0 and Deployment chapters have been completely rewritten to reflect the latest thinking. Now you can learn which environments are best for your style application, and see how Capistrano makes managing your site simple. All the remaining chapters have been extensively updated. Finally, hundreds of comments from readers of the first edition have been incorporated, making this book simply the best available.    Rails is a full-stack, open source web framework that enables you to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications with a twist...you can create a full Rails application using less code than the setup XML you&apos;d need just to configure some other frameworks.    With this book, you&apos;ll learn how to use Rails Active Record to connect business objects and database tables.  No more painful object-relational mapping.  Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest.  You&apos;ll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, talk to web services, and interact dynamically with JavaScript applications running in the browser (the &quot;Ajax&quot; architecture).      You&apos;ll see how easy it is to deploy Rails.  You&apos;ll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all.

      Product Description
  Praise for Design Patterns in Ruby&quot;Design Patterns in Ruby documents smart ways to resolve many problems that Ruby developers commonly encounter. Russ Olsen has done a great job of selecting classic patterns and augmenting these with newer patterns that have special relevance for Ruby. He clearly explains each idea, making a wealth of experience available to Ruby developers for their own daily work.&quot;?Steve Metsker, Managing Consultant with Dominion Digital, Inc.&quot;This book provides a great demonstration of the key &apos;Gang of Four&apos; design patterns without resorting to overly technical explanations. Written in a precise, yet almost informal style, this book covers enough ground that even those without prior exposure to design patterns will soon feel confident applying them using Ruby. Olsen has done a great job to make a book about a classically &apos;dry&apos; subject into such an engaging and even occasionally humorous read.&quot;?Peter Cooper&quot;This book renewed my interest in understanding patterns after a decade of good intentions. Russ picked the most useful patterns for Ruby and introduced them in a straightforward and logical manner, going beyond the GoF&apos;s patterns. This book has improved my use of Ruby, and encouraged me to blow off the dust covering the GoF book.&quot;?Mike Stok&quot;Design Patterns in Ruby is a great way for programmers from statically typed objectoriented languages to learn how design patterns appear in a more dynamic, flexible language like Ruby.&quot;?Rob Sanheim, Ruby Ninja, RelevanceMost design pattern books are based on C++ and Java. But Ruby is different?and the language&apos;s unique qualities make design patterns easier to implement and use. In this book, Russ Olsen demonstrates how to combine Ruby&apos;s power and elegance with patterns, and write more sophisticated, effective software with far fewer lines of code.After reviewing the history, concepts, and goals of design patterns, Olsen offers a quick tour of the Ruby language?enough to allow any experienced software developer to immediately utilize patterns with Ruby. The book especially calls attention to Ruby features that simplify the use of patterns, including dynamic typing, code closures, and &quot;mixins&quot; for easier code reuse.Fourteen of the classic &quot;Gang of Four&quot; patterns are considered from the Ruby point of view, explaining what problems each pattern solves, discussing whether traditional implementations make sense in the Ruby environment, and introducing Ruby-specific improvements. You&apos;ll discover opportunities to implement patterns in just one or two lines of code, instead of the endlessly repeated boilerplate that conventional languages often require.Design Patterns in Ruby also identifies innovative new patterns that have emerged from the Ruby community. These include ways to create custom objects with metaprogramming, as well as the ambitious Rails-based &quot;Convention Over Configuration&quot; pattern, designed to help integrate entire applications and frameworks.Engaging, practical, and accessible, Design Patterns in Ruby will help you build better software while making your Ruby programming experience more rewarding.

      Product Description
  Are you a tester who spends more time manually creating complex test data than using it? A business analyst who seemingly went to college all those years so you can spend your days copying data from reports into spreadsheets? A programmer who can&apos;t finish each day&apos;s task without having to scan through version control system output, looking for the file you want?    If so, you&apos;re wasting that computer on your desk. Offload the drudgery to where it belongs, and free yourself to do what you should be doing: thinking. All you need is a scripting language (free!), this book (cheap!), and the dedication to work through the examples and exercises.    Everyday Scripting with Ruby is divided into four parts. In the first, you&apos;ll learn the basics of the Ruby scripting language. In the second, you&apos;ll see how to create scripts in a steady, controlled way using test-driven design. The third part is about finding, understanding, and using the work of others--and about preparing your scripts for others to use. The fourth part, more advanced, is about saving even more time by using application frameworks.

Sometimes he was a programmer. Sometimes he was a tester. He became better at each because he understood the other.    Brian is the author of The Craft of Software Testing, which promotes test design techniques, how testers support the team, and unscripted exploratory manual testing. He was an author of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and was the second chair of the Agile Alliance board of directors.

      Product Description
  Ruby on Rails is the super-productive new way to develop full-featured web applications. With Ruby on Rails, powerful web applications that once took weeks or months to develop can now be produced in a matter of days. If it sounds too good to be true, it isn&apos;t.  If you&apos;re like a lot of web developers, you&apos;ve probably considered kicking the tires on Rails - the framework of choice for the new generation of Web 2.0 developers. &quot;Ruby on Rails: Up and Running&quot; takes you out for a test drive and shows you just how fast Ruby on Rails can go.  This compact guide teaches you the basics of installing and using both the Ruby scripting language and the Rails framework for the quick development of web applications. &quot;Ruby on Rails: Up and Running&quot; covers just about everything you need - from making a simple database-backed application to adding elaborate Ajaxian features and all the juicy bits in between. While Rails is praised for its simplicity and speed of development, there are still a few steps to master on the way. More advanced material helps you map data to an imperfect table, traverse complex relationships, and build custom finders. A section on working with Ajax and REST shows you how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic user-centric web pages. The book also explains the essentials of logging to find performance problems and delves into other performance-optimizing techniques.  As new web development frameworks go, Ruby on Rails is the talk of the town. And &quot;Ruby on Rails: Up and Running&quot; can make sure you&apos;re in on the discussion.
