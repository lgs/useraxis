***************************************************************************************
1.1.2.1
FIX: if the event date was formatted using new setting, the event date was incorrect.
***************************************************************************************
1.1.2.0

FEATURES ADDED:

** New settings, <bg_color> and <bg_alpha> for <y_left> and <y_right> of the <values> 
allows showing a color rectangle under y axis values. This might improve readability.

** New settings, <unit> and <unit_position> for <y_left> and <y_right> of the <values> 
allows showing units near y axis values. 

** a new group of settings:

<digits_after_decimal>
  <data></data>
  <percents></percents>
</digits_after_decimal>

was added in two places:

1) <charts><chart><values><y_left> and <charts><chart><values><y_right>. This allows 
controlling of the number of decimals for the axis values.

2) <charts><chart><graphs><graph><legend>. This allows controlling of the number of
decimals for the legend values.


** <events> was added to <date_formats>, so you could format how the date in the event
balloon should look like. 


** <connect> settng for the <graph> allows displaying  gaps in the line and step graphs
types, when data is missing. 


** <connect> setting is also added for the <scroller>


** JavaScript functions are cued now - previously you could call one JS function at a 
time and call another only after the chart finished the previous process. Now, you can
call several functions one after another, without waiting for the chart to finish 
doing something. The functions are cued and all of them will be executed.


** New JavaScript function amProcessCompleted(chart_id, process) added
This function is called after some process initialized by some JS function is finished.
For example, if you make the chart to reload data by calling reloadData function, after
the data is reloaded, the chart will call amProcessCompleted function and the "process"
parameter will be "reloadData" - the same as the function name you called.  


FIXES:

** The first data set was always selected as main, even the 
<main_drop_down selected="true"></main_drop_down> was set for some other data set.  


** events, hidden with javascript appeared again after scrolling.


** when the empty data was passed with setData(data) JS function, the chart didn't
display the "no data" message.

***************************************************************************************
1.1.1.0

FEATURES ADDED:

** from and to dates
You can set custom "from" and "to" dates now in:
<period_selector>
  ...
  <from></from>
  <to></to>

** dashed horizontal and vertical lines can be used with events

** border_alpha setting for events added

  
FIXES:
** The scrollbar graph dropped to 0 if the values were missing, now it connects the points 
as the main graph does.

** If settings were passed directly from HTML, context menu settings were ignored.

** resize_pointer_color was ignored.

** chart_id wasn't passed to JS functions after setSettings function was used. 

***************************************************************************************
1.1.0.0

FEATURES ADDED:

**Events in the settings file
Events can be added directly to the settings file, within <events></events> in the 
<data_set> section. This will allow you to have all the data in one file only.

**Horizontal and vertical lines (guides)
The events were extended so that the chart can display horizontal and vertical guides 
(barriers). Check the new structured_products example to see how this is done. 

**Base date of recalculation
Previously, when comparing the data sets, the values were recalculated from the 
selected period first date or from the first date of the data set. Now you can set any 
base date.  Value of a base date will be used as a base for recalculation. This might be
useful for structured financial products. You can set the base using <base_data> 
setting in the <comparing> settings. Check the structured_products example to see how
this is done. 

**Show / hide events with JavaScript
You can show/hide events with a new JS functions: flashMovie.showEvents(); and
flashMovie.hideEvents(); 

**12 or 24 hour format in the legend and axis
12 hour time format can be displayed in the legend and axis values. To do this, you
should set <hour_format>12</hour_format> in the date_formats settings. Hours in the 
data file must always be in 24 hour format. 

**Show comparing legend entries only 
You can make the legend to display entries of comparing data sets only and not to 
display the legend entry of a graph by setting <comparing_only> in the graphs's legend
settings. 

**Hide date in the legend when mouse is away from plot area
The date in the legend can be hidden when the mouse is not over the plot area. This 
might help you to avoid overlapping of date and legend entries, as the date takes more 
space when displaying period instead of single date. To hide the date, set:
<hide_date_on_period>true</hide_date_on_period> in the chart's legend settings. 

**Disabling interactivity
You can disable all the interactivity of a chart by setting 
<interactive>false</interactive> 

**Error messages
A new group of settings - <error_messages> was added. You can disable error messages,
set colors and opacity. 

**Keeping selected data sets after setSettings() function
Previously, after you use setSettings() JavaScript function, the data sets selected by
user were reset to the initial state. Now the chart keeps the selections. A new 
parameter to the setSettings function added, in order you don't want to keep the
selections: setSettings(settings, rebuild, reset_selected) 

BUG FIXES: 

flashMovie.print() and flashMovie.printAsBitmap() functions where not work properly in 
some cases.

JS functions amClickedOn(chart_id, date, period) and amRolledOver(chart_id, date, period)
were returning not full date and undefined period in some cases.

JS function on error, amError(chart_id, message) wasn't called when the error occurred.

***************************************************************************************

1.0.2.3
Bug fix: the first <letter> from <number_format> was ignored. Fixed.

***************************************************************************************
1.0.2.2
Bug fix: Events became visible only after scrolling or change of interval. Fixed.

***************************************************************************************
1.0.2.1

Feature added:
When comparing the graphs, you could set that the graph's values must be recalculated
to percents. With a new setting, <recalculate_from_start>, you can set that the first 
value of a graph would be used as "base" value for the recalculation. Previously only
the first value of a selected period could be used.  

Improvement: Now, if the data source doesn't have column which should be used as 
graph's <close> data source, the graph will not have legend entry in the legend. The
same is with comparing graphs - if the selected for comparing data set doesn't have
the column which must be used for comparing graph, This data set will not have entry
in the legend.

Bug fix: <digits_after_decimal><data> setting only added required number of zeros, 
not rounded the numbers when the data was grouped to a longer periods. 

Bug fix: If the chart had graphs both on left and right axes and also had events,
the events were displayed for two times instead of one.

***************************************************************************************
1.0.2.0

Feature added:
Smoothed lines feature added. Set <smoothed>true</smoothed> in graph's settings to 
make lines smooth.

"%" is added to Y axis values when charts are compared.

Bug fix: when <equal_spacing> was set to "false" and there were multiple graphs with
type "column", the columns were displaced incorrectly.

***************************************************************************************
1.0.1.1

Bug fixes:
When the <equal_spacing> was set to false, amGetZoom returned wrong "to" value.

JS functions: amRolledOver, amClickedOn, amRolledOverEvent and amClickedOnEvent
Used not to return chart_id variable. This is fixed now. Note, if you were using these 
functions before, you should add chart_id variable in front of the others, otherwise your
script will not work. 

Features added:

New javascript function setSettings(settings, rebuild) allows you to set 
multiple settings at once.

You can get chart settings using getSettings() JavaScript function.

When the chart finishes exporting it to the image, amReturnImageData(chart_id, data)
function is called.
